# Workspace Governance

Contributor-neutral rules for custody and traceability of changes in OwlBear-enabled projects.

## Commit Discipline

### Format

```text
type: description (#task-id, context)
```

**Types:** `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `test` (test additions or changes), `docs`
(documentation), `chore` (tooling, dependencies, or configuration), and `refactor` (code restructure
without behavior change).

**Example:** `feat: implement retry logic (#480, builder)`

### Rules

- One logical commit per agent per task. No micro-commits or multi-task batches.
- Commit only files owned by the current task. A mixed index is not a reason to skip a task-owned
  commit.
- Use the shared scoped helper:
  `uv --project {owlbear-root} run commit-owned -m "type: description (#task-id, agent)" -- path [path...]`.
- The helper preserves unrelated staged paths and unstages only its own paths if `git commit` fails.
  It rejects owned paths that were already staged because it cannot distinguish user work from agent
  work in the same path.
- Pipeline agents commit task-owned durable changes before successful lifecycle advancement.
  Builders own product and durable proof files, verifiers own local fixes, and collectors own board
  or archive changes they make.
- Never push. The user pushes manually.

### VS Code Auto-Staging Trap

VS Code may re-serialize and stage `.agent.md` files when it detects new tool capabilities. Run
`git diff --cached share/agents/` before committing and unstage unrelated generated changes without
reverting them.

## OwlBear-Managed Artifact Placement

| Artifact | Location | Rule |
|----------|----------|------|
| Temporary output, debug files, and one-off scripts | `.owlbear/scratch/{task-id}-{description}.{ext}` | Untracked; delete before task closure. |
| Approved external repository clones | `.owlbear/scratch/research/{repo-name}/` | Inspect only; delete before task closure. |
| Durable research findings | `.owlbear/research/{slug}.md` | Tracked; include the task reference. |
| External source attribution | `.owlbear/sources/overview.md` | Tracked; use the Attribution schema below. |
| Decision and action requests | `.owlbear/kanban/decisions/` | Create through Kanban tools; do not hand-author alternate locations. |
| Generated navigation indexes | `.owlbear/doc-index.md`, `.owlbear/py-index.md`, `.owlbear/ts-index.md` | Regenerate with `uv run --project {owlbear-root} indexes {project-root}`. |

Project-owned source, test, documentation, and benchmark locations come from the local project map,
manifests, and existing structure. Use `h-codebase-orientation` to discover them; do not impose
OwlBear's own source layout on consuming projects.

Shared agent ecosystem assets follow `h-agent-structure`; project-local customizations live under
the corresponding `.owlbear/agents/`, `.owlbear/skills/`, `.owlbear/instructions/`, and
`.owlbear/prompts/` directories.

## Attribution

External code and patterns must be logged in `.owlbear/sources/overview.md`:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Source | Project or article name |
| URL | Link to the repository, article, or documentation |
| What | Pattern, code snippet, architecture idea, or other material used |
| Where Used | File path or module where it was applied |
| Date | Date adopted |
